# HueSlopeField
### A Java application to realize the slope-fields of first-order differential equations as grids of slopes (0-360 deg) in their Hue-Saturation-Brightness (HSB) representation

## Examples
Below are a couple example images of what you can create with this little Java application, just by paying around with the Function and Hue Range. A word of caution: this application is pretty slow once you start making the window large.
